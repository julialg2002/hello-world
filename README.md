Hello world!

It seems like I have to write a little bit about myself. So here it goes.

My name is Julia López Gómez and I am a first year undergraduate studying a BSc in Computer Science and Mathematics. I am from Spain, but currently staying in Edinburgh for the academic year. Looking forward to meet all of my classmates.

And yeah, that would be it.
